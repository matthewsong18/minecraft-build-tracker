# Wingmen Builds

A tool designed for Wingmen to track builds and manage the items required for
each build.

Users can:

- Search for items and specify the quantity they need.

- Add items to their build list and track required materials.

- Automatically account for dependencies (items needed to craft another item).

Additionally, others can view public build lists and offer help by gathering
required items.

## Features

- Detailed item requirement tree showing dependencies for crafted items.

- Suggested sources for items (e.g., farms or locations).

- Public build lists visible to others who want to help.

- Collaborative support for gathering items.
